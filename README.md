# PENG
Controlled Natural Language - Processable English - Natural Language Processing

Processable English (PENG) is a controlled natural language (CNL) that serves as
a high-level speciﬁcation language for logic programs. The writing in a CNL needs
to be supported by a smart text editor. Such as smart text editor guides users
to write speciﬁcations in PENG without requiring knowledge of the language.
The text editor provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with the
language processor and oﬀers user feedback during sentence construction to help
write syntactically correct sentences. The aim of this project is to improve the
previous version of the text editor for PENG. This is a complex task since the
previous text editor was tightly integrated with the CNL backend. Therefore, this
work has been conducted in two stages: ﬁrst, we have to refactor and restructure
the codebase to make it readable and maintainable. Second, we have to implement
new features that will allow easier modiﬁcation and merging of speciﬁcations. The
text editor will then be tested for diﬀerent example speciﬁcations. The outcome
of this project will result in improved user experience when using the text editor.
